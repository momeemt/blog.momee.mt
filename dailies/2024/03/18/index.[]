{* Thoughts}
I'm starting to get interested in English, so from today I will be writing a post in the foreign language every day.
I couldn't remeber why I stopped, although I remembered trying to do it when I was at school.

It was already afternoon when I woke up. Alcohol brings no benefits. I can't trust alcohol and people who like it. 

Tomorrow I will write longer statements than today. I have studied reading and listening for TOEIC although improving writing skills may require other learning. I currently use [@ DeepL Write, https://www.deepl.com/write] for polishing statements, but I want to be able to write alone.
I can go to bed early for the first time in a long time. Good night!
